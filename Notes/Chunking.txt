What is Chunking


Types of Chunking

	I). Fixed Size Chunking (Length-Based)
		1. Normal Python Code with for loop slitting.
		2. Using Langchain
			Langchain.text_splitter import "Character
		3.Using llama Index
			To extract Raw text from file --> llama_index.readers.file import FlatReader
			For Chunk Splitting --> llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
	
	II). Recursive Chunking (Text-Structure Based)
		Text is structured in hierarchical way like paragraphs → sentences → words.
		We can use this structure to split text intelligently.
		Goal:
			→ Keep natural flow of language
			→ Ensure each chunk is semantically meaningful
			→ Support different levels of granularity (fine-grained vs. coarse-grained chunks)
		
		→ from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
		→ from llama_index.node_parser import LangchainNodeParser
		
	III). Document Chunking (Document-Based)
	
	IV). Semantic Chunking
